# BChaneyPA1

## Configuration Info

Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04

C++ Compiler: g++ 11.3.0

In addition to the above OS and compiler have been able to build this project on these other systems:

- WSL 2 Ubuntu 22.04, g++ 11.3
- Windows 10, MSVC 19
- Windows 10, MSVC 22

Build System: CMake 3.22.1

IDE/Editors: 

- NeoVim 0.9
- Visual Studio Code version 1.75.1 with the most recent version of the C/C++ extension pack.

I have included my compiled executable in the top directory of this zip, it will not be overwritten when you build from source using CMake

## How to Build

- I am assuming that the user has access to a Unix-like system with CMake installed or has access to Microsoft Visual Studio's C++ development kit.
- If building directly from cli, from the zip directory, execute the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
cmake --build .
cd ..
```

- The compiled executable should now be ready at ./build/closest-pairs !

## How to Run

- Once the executable is built we can run the program by calling `./build/closest-pairs` from the command line. This program also expects the filepath of a data file as the second argument and the value for `m` as the third command line argument. The resulting output to the console is a comparison of the results between the brute force and efficient methods.

## Additional Files

- Some data files are included in the data/ directory.
- All data files used in this project were generated by the python script `make_points.py`. The bash scripts `data.sh` and `experiments.sh` were used to generate sets of data and get experimental numbers of comparisons.
